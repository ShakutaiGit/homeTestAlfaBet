Project Title
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

API Overview
This project implements a RESTFUL API for managing events, with the following endpoints:

POST /events: Schedule a new event.
GET /events: Retrieve a list of all scheduled events.
GET /events/:id: Retrieve details of a specific event.
PUT /events/:id: Update details of a specific event.
DELETE /events/:id: Delete a specific event.
Using the API with Postman
A Postman collection is available for easy interaction with the API. To use it:

Import the collection into Postman.
Ensure the API server is running.
Send requests to the API via Postman.
Architecture:


The project is structured using the Ports & Adapters (also known as Hexagonal Architecture) methodology. This design pattern promotes the separation of concerns by dividing the application into distinct layers:

Domain Layer: Contains the business logic.
Application Layer: Coordinates high-level application behavior.
Adapters Layer: Connects the application with external concerns like databases and web interfaces.
Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:


Copy code
go test ./... -v
This command runs all the tests in the project and provides verbose output. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of individual units of code independently of external systems.

Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project and install its dependencies:

Clone the Repository:


Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Navigate to the Project Directory:


Copy code
cd [project-name]
Install Dependencies:
The project uses Go Modules for dependency management. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:


Copy code
go mod tidy
Start the Server:

Copy code
go run main.go
This starts the server on the default port (e.g., :8080). Ensure this port is available or adjust the port in the configuration.
