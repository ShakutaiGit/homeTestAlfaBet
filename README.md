# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## API Overview

This project implements a RESTful API for managing events, with the following endpoints:

- `POST /events`: Schedule a new event.
- `GET /events`: Retrieve a list of all scheduled events.
- `GET /events/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific event.
- `PUT /events/:id`: Update details of a specific event.
- `DELETE /events/:id`: Delete a specific event.

### Using the API with Postman

A Postman collection is available for easy interaction with the API. To use it:
1. Import the collection into Postman.
2. Ensure the API server is running.
3. Send requests to the API via Postman.

## Architecture

The project is structured using the Ports & Adapters (also known as Hexagonal Architecture) methodology. This design pattern promotes the separation of concerns by dividing the application into distinct layers:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic.
- **Application Layer**: Coordinates high-level application behavior.
- **Adapters Layer**: Connects the application with external concerns like databases and web interfaces.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go test ./... -v
```

This command runs all the tests in the project and provides verbose output. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of individual units of code independently of external systems.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project and install its dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd [project-name]
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   The project uses Go Modules for dependency management. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   This starts the server on the default port (e.g., `:8080`). Ensure this port is available or adjust the port in the configuration.

### Customizing the README

- Replace placeholders like `[repository-url]`, `[project-name]`, and other project-specific details with actual information.
- If there are additional setup steps (like setting up a database or environment variables), include those in the Installation & Setup section.
- If your API requires authentication or specific headers, include that information in the API Overview section.
